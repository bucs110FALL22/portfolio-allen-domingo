# Final Project Milestone #1

[Final Project Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3zgypVjPjzXl4pL1_Wpjvp3GLCW9zcFydkwUjNfNUA/edit?usp=sharing)

In order to start the Final Project for the course, you will need to decide on the following (remember, nothing is set in stone yet).

Review the sample Final Projects listed below and come up with 3 possible ideas of your own for your final project. Complete this document in **your** portfolio (CH 4). A few things to note:

1. ***Don't limit yourself***
    * I will help you scale it to something manageable, but it is  uch easier to scake something down than to scale up. Shoot for the stars.

2. ***Your idea WILL change, don't worry about the details yet.***
    * Just think of a general type of game, simulation, or other kind of program you would like to create.

***

For each one below you should have a basic description of a program idea, a couple of sentences at least. You can add as much info here as you like. This is where you want to brainstorm a little, and nothing is *'wrong'*.

## Project Idea 1

Oregon Trail but with the Nature preserve

Going through the nature preserve with a couple of buddies, trekking through the dangerous terrain. Try to keep sanity and other stats such as health and hunger at a good level, moderating supplies to make sure you all make it through alive. Survive encounters with Harvey Stenger, Baxter, and other hungry bearcats as you try your best to get through.

## Project Idea 2

Student simulator akin to "BitLife"

Try to keep grades up while not burdening yourself with a lack of social life. Advance month by month as you make choices with the little time you have. Try to do as much as you can to make the most of everything while trying to graduate on time. Keep everything in moderation here while keeping things interesting, setting aside study time, and encountering scenarios that you have the choices that will shape your future.

## Project Idea 3

A software instrument

Either a synth or piano like instrument, it will use the keyboard to play the notes. It will include polyphony and also adjustable parameters. Add a filer, chorus, or other effects to create a unique, but usable instrument.
